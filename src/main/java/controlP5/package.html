<h1>ControlP5</h1>
<p>ControlP5 (<a href="http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5" target="_blank">www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5</a>) is a library written by Andreas Schlegel for the programming environment <a href="http://www.processing.org" target="_blank">processing</a>. ControlP5 is a GUI and controller library for processing that can be used in authoring, application mode. Controllers including Sliders, Buttons, Toggles, Knobs, Textfields, RadioButtons, Checkboxes amongst others can be easily added to a processing sketch and can be arranged in separate control windows, or can be organized in tabs or groups. The controlP5 source code repository is available on github at <a href="http://github.com/sojamo/controlp5" target="_blank">github.com/sojamo/controlp5</a>. 
</p>
<h1>Javascript</h1>
<p>Currently there is no javascript version of ControlP5, though I had started implementing a slimmed down version for processing.js but since it is currently unclear which javascript version, processing.js or p5.js, will become the default js version of processing, controlP5.js is on hold.</p>
